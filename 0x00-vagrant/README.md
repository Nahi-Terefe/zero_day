## Zero Day Vulnerability

A zero-day is a computer-software vulnerability unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation.
Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional
computers or a network. An exploit directed at a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.<br>
